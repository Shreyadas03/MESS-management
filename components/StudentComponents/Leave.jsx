                Hostel Leave Rules<br /><br />

                To ensure the safety and well-being of all residents, the following leave rules must be adhered to:<br /><br />

                <ul style={listStyle}>
                    <li style={listItemStyle}><strong>Leave Application:</strong> Residents must submit a formal leave application to the hostel office at least 24 hours before the intended leave date. The application should include the reason for leave, duration, and a contact number where the resident can be reached.</li>
                    <li style={listItemStyle}><strong>Approval Process:</strong> Leave requests will be reviewed and approved based on necessity and availability. Residents will be notified of the approval status via email or in-person communication. Any unapproved leave will be considered unauthorized.</li>
                    <li style={listItemStyle}><strong>Leave Duration:</strong> Regular leave is granted for a maximum of 48 hours at a time. Extended leave requests must be accompanied by a valid reason and supporting documentation.</li>
                    <li style={listItemStyle}><strong>Sign-Out and Sign-In:</strong> Upon leaving the hostel, residents must sign out in the hostel register and sign in upon their return. Failure to comply with this procedure may result in disciplinary action.</li>
                    <li style={listItemStyle}><strong>Emergency Leave:</strong> In the case of emergencies, residents should inform the hostel authorities as soon as possible and provide necessary documentation upon return.</li>
                    <li style={listItemStyle}><strong>Accountability:</strong> Residents are responsible for ensuring that their leave does not interfere with their academic responsibilities or hostel rules. Repeated or unauthorized absences may lead to disciplinary measures.</li>
                </ul>

                We appreciate your cooperation in following these guidelines to maintain a safe and orderly environment for all hostel residents.
